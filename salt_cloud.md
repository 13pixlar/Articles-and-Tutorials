Automated Provisioning of DigitalOcean Cloud Servers with Salt Cloud
=====

### Introduction

Salt Cloud is a public cloud provisioning tool. It integrates [Salt](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-salt-on-ubuntu-12-04) with DigitalOcean's [application programming interface (API)](https://www.digitalocean.com/api/) in a clean way, so that DigitalOcean droplets (i.e. cloud servers or VPS) can be quickly and easily modeled and provisioned.

## Benefits

Salt Cloud allows for cloud-based servers to be managed via virtual machine maps and profiles. This means that DigitalOcean droplets can be created individually, or large groups of systems can be managed at once. Droplets created with Salt Cloud have Salt automatically installed and are assigned to a specified *master*. This means that droplets can be provisioned and potentially never need to be logged into.
